I will create a classification algorithm for a bank marketing campaign dataset.

-The Problem
A bank has experienced a decline in revenue and investigation has revealed that the decrease in revenue can be attributed to a decline in client deposits. The bank aims to identify existing clients who are more likely to subscribe to term deposits. By focusing marketing efforts on these clients, the bank can maximize its chances of increasing term deposit subscriptions and ultimately drive revenue growth.

-Dataset
The dataset provides information on marketing campaigns conducted by a Portugal bank. The campaigns primarily involved direct phone calls, with the objective of convincing bank clients to place a term deposit. The target variable indicates whether the client agreed to place a deposit ('yes') or not ('no').
